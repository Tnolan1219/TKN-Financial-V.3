      <h2>BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front</h2>
      <p>The government is fully reopened. Pay, benefits, and base support programs are returning to normal operations. This is the moment to review your LES, rebuild your financial buffer, and follow up on anything delayed during the shutdown.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Situation Report -->
    <section class="tile">
      <h2>Situation Report</h2>
      <p>Washington’s funding deal ends several weeks of uncertainty that affected military households nationwide. While pay continued, the potential for processing slowdowns created stress for families trying to plan ahead. With the government restored, DFAS and personnel offices are clearing outstanding administrative actions.</p>

      <p>Across installations, base programs are resuming full staffing levels. Childcare centers, family support offices, and legal services are reopening their appointment books and working through backlogs. The next few weeks may be especially busy as families catch up on delayed needs.</p>

      <p>TSP operations continued through the shutdown, but some administrative requests were delayed. With staffing restored, contribution changes, rollover approvals, and loan actions should process on normal timelines again. Members who paused contributions should reassess allocations and long-term plans.</p>

      <p>Many families relied on savings or short-term credit during the shutdown. This reopening period is a chance to stabilize your budget, rebuild reserves, and ensure your financial routines are back on track before the next unexpected event occurs.</p>
